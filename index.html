        <h3>Skills and Achievements</h3>
        <p>I started learning to code a few years ago because I wanted to have a deep understanding on how the algorithms work. Over time, I have gained also experience in data analysis and machine learning by doing some courses.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <p>One of my many passions is basketball. I love to play it with my friends and I'm also a big fan of the NBA. I also love to travel and that is why I spend part of my spare time organising my next holidays.</p>
